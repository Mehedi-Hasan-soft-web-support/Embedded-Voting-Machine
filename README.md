# Embedded-Voting-Machine with Coupon Authentication and ThingSpeak Cloud Integration

This project implements a microcontroller-based Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) using an ESP32, I2C LCD, 4x4 keypad, and ThingSpeak for cloud-based vote tracking. The voting system supports unique coupon-based voter authentication to prevent duplicate voting.

## üö¶ Voting Flow

1. **Welcome Screen:** Voter is prompted to press `1` to vote or `*` to enter admin mode.
2. **Coupon Entry:** Voter inputs a unique code and confirms with `#`.
3. **Voting Stages:** Voter votes for:
   - President
   - General Secretary
   - Vice President
4. **Confirmation:** Voter reviews and confirms vote.
5. **Cloud Sync:** Votes are sent to ThingSpeak channel.

---

## üîë Admin Mode

Accessed by pressing `*` on the welcome screen.

- Press `1` to display local results
- Press `2` to manually sync data with ThingSpeak
- Press `#` to exit admin mode

---

## ‚òÅÔ∏è ThingSpeak Configuration

- Create a channel with at least 6 fields (one per candidate).
- Replace your **API Key** and **Channel ID** in the code.

```cpp
const char* server = "api.thingspeak.com";
String writeAPIKey = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE";
unsigned long channelID = YOUR_CHANNEL_ID;
